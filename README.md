Detrended Cross-Correlation Analysis
=================================================

A module to perform DCCA coefficients analysis. The coefficient ```rho``` describes the correlation strengh between two time series depending on time scales. it lies in [-1, 1], 1 being perfect correlations, and -1 perfect anticorrelations.\
The package provides also functions returning a 95% confidence interval for the null-hypothesis (= "no-correlations").

The implementation is based on 
Zebende G, Da Silva M MacHado, Filho A. *DCCA cross-correlation coefficient differentiation: Theoretical and practical approaches* Physica A: Statistical Mechanics and its Applications
(2013)
and was tested by reproducing the results of _DCCA and DMCA correlations of cryptocurrency markets_ from
Paulo Ferreira,
Ladislav Kristoufk and Eder Johnson de Area LeÃ£oPereira.

## Perform a DCCA coefficients computation:

Call the ```rhoDCCA``` function like :
```
pts, rho = rhoDCCA(timeSeries1, timeSeries2)
```

The function `rhoDCCA` has the following parameters:
```Julia
rhoDCCA(timeSeries1, timeSeries2; box_start = 3, box_stop = div(length(series1),10), nb_pts = 30)
``` 
**Input arguments**:
* ```timeSeries1, timeSeries2``` : the time series to analyse (have to be array of **Float64**), having the **same length**.
* ```box_start = 3, box_stop``` : the starting and ending point of the analysis. defaults to 3 (the minimal possible time-scale) and 1/10th of the data length (passed this size the variance gets big).
* ```nb_pt``` : the number of points you want to evalute the analysis onto. mostly relevant for plotting

**Returns**:
* ```pts``` : the list of points where the analysis was carried out
* ```rho``` : the value of the DCCA coefficient at each of these points

## Get the 95% confidence interval
As a rule of thumb : values of ```rho``` in [-0.1,0.1] usually aren't significant.

The confidence intervals provided by this package correspond to the **null-hypothesis** i.e **no correlations**. If ```rho``` gets **outside** of this interval it can be considered **significant**.

To get a fast estimation of the confidence interval, call the ```empirical_CI``` function like : ```pts, ci = empirical_CI(dataLength)```. 

For a more accurate estimation, you can call ```bootstrap_CI``` : ```pts, ci = bootstrap_CI(timeSeries1, timeSeries2; iterations = 200)```. This operation is much more demanding and can take up to several minutes. The ```iterations``` argument controls the number of repetitions for the bootstrap procedure, the higher the value, the smoother and cleaner the estimation will be, but it will also take longer.

## Example of simple analysis:

calling the DCCA function with random white noise

```julia
julia> x1 = rand(2000); x2 = rand(2000)
x,y = rhoDCCA(x1,x2)
pts, ci = empirical_CI(length(x1))
```
Gave the following plot :

```julia
a = scatter(x,y, markersize = 7, xscale = :log, title = "Example of DCCA analysis : \n Correlations between two white noise time series", label = "rho coefficients", xlabel = "window sizes", ylabel = "Correlation strengh")
plot!(a,pts,ci, color = "red", linestyle = :dot, label = "limits of null-hypothesis")
plot!(a,pts,-ci, color = "red", linestyle = :dot, label = "")
display(a)
```

As noted previously, the value here lies in [-0.1,0.1] although we took here 2 series of white uncorrelated noise.
